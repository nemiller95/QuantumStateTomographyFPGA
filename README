N. E. Miller, B. Chakraborty and S. Mukhopadhyay, "A Reconfigurable Quantum State Tomography Solver in FPGA," 2023 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), Bellevue, WA, USA, 2023, pp. 1412-1421, doi: 10.1109/QCE57702.2023.00160.

The index encodings, easily produced by the produce_tensor function in "produce_ATAA" are shown in the index_encodings directory for n=[1,6].

The directory lagos_data_signed32bit are sample expectation value data for circuits run according to the cited work using the IBM Lagos noise model and 32-bit fixed point encoding. This data is only useful as an example input for the Vivado project.

To create an n-qubit tomography solver, users must reconfigure the BRAM and BROM controllers, as well as the qst_32.v file and its inputs, according to the memory sizes described in the paper.
